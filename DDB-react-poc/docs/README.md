# React DDB 2.0

## Introduction
`React DDB 2.0` is an in development POC replacement for the Audit Digital Dashboard. 

The main inspiration for the project is that the old dashboard is no longer being updated and has been put on feature freeze, with functionality breaking as Chromium updates are pushed to Working Papers. It also uses old web development technology (Google Web Toolkit) that is no longer being maintained, and has been superseded by more modern frameworks such as Angular and React. 

It's important that the Audit Dashboard is as modern and user-friendly as possible as it's able to serve as a gateway to the rest of the Audit Template, and it's to this end that we've worked on this project.

## Documentation
The goal of documenting the `DDB 2.0` project from the get-go is to try and avoid some of the problems we've had with little/no documentation in areas of our other codebases. It not only helps us develop the POC faster, it will also serve as a good base to start from in the case that this project makes it onto the roadmap. Also we like writing documented code because we know the struggle.

We've included [guides](/guide/) to get started in developing for some of the more common features that will probably be worked on, API documentation on the [components](/components/) of the project, and documentation on overall project infrastructure and other details in our [Reference](/reference/) section.
